(Movie Recommendation System)

-This is a data science movie recommendation project that utilizes machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user input.

1- Project Overview:
In this project, I explored and analyzed a movie dataset using the Plotly library for data visualization. I performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accurate results. By converting the movie features into vectors and calculating cosine similarity, I developed a recommendation engine that suggests similar movies based on user preferences.


2- Features:

a- Data Exploration and Analysis: Utilized Plotly library to visualize and gain insights from the movie dataset.

b- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Performed data cleaning techniques to handle missing values and ensure data quality. Preprocessed the movie features to prepare them for recommendation.

c- Vectorization and Similarity Calculation: Converted the movie features into vectors and calculated cosine similarity to determine the similarity between movies.

d- Recommendation Engine: Implemented a recommendation function that takes user input and provides personalized recommendations based on their preferences.

e- Graphical User Interface: Developed a GUI using the tkinter library to enhance the user experience. Users can easily enter a movie title and receive relevant recommendations.

3-Technologies Used:
a- Python
b- Plotly
c- tkinter
